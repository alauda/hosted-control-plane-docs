1. Overview

HowTo documents are practical technical documents focused on solving specific problems in particular scenarios. They combine product features with real-world application scenarios to provide users with comprehensive solution guidance.

2. Document Characteristics

HowTo documents have the following core characteristics:

* Scenario-Oriented: Provide end-to-end solutions based on specific user scenarios.
* High Practicality: Directly answer the question "how to achieve a specific goal," focusing on practical operation guidance.
* Completeness: Cover the entire process from problem analysis to solution implementation.
* Reproducibility: Users can follow the document steps to replicate the solution in similar scenarios.

3. Preparation for Writing

Before starting to write a HowTo document, clarify the following elements:

Target Scenario Analysis
   - Identify the specific needs and pain points of users.
   - Determine the applicability of the solution.
   - Evaluate implementation conditions and possible limitations.

Audience Positioning
   - Identify the target readers (e.g., developers, operations personnel, system administrators).
   - Assess the readers' technical background and knowledge level.
   - Understand the readers' work scenarios and environments.

# [HowTo Title: Usually Starts with a Verb]

> Function name. If the purpose is strong, it is recommended to clearly define the task goal, preferably starting with a verb, such as: Connect Cluster/Upgrade Cluster

## Introduction

> There is no fixed introduction format, but consider what it is, usage scenarios, and purpose when thinking about this function.

## Scenarios

> Consider what this function is, its usage scenarios, and its purpose.

Before using the function, ensure:

- Condition 1
- Condition 2
- ......

## Steps

> Provide specific steps for using this function. If necessary, provide "Tips," "Notes," or "Warnings" under relevant steps.

Use the function by following these steps:

1. Step 1

> For step descriptions, we recommend using clear executable steps, such as: Expand the Deployment replica count to 3, rather than using overly vague expressions: Increase the number of instances.

2. Step 2
3. ......

Parameter explanations are as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
