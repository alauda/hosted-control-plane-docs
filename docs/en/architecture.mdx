:::tip
The purpose of writing a "Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the function.

It is recommended to link the "concepts" introduced in the architecture to the corresponding sections in "Concepts" below. If the introduced "concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate document, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate "Understanding XXXX" article in the current directory to provide a thorough introduction.

You can view an [Architecture Document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for reference.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams of the function, which may include the following content:

- Core Components: Such as Operators, tasks, middleware, etc., and depict the relationships and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: Such as introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the process of resource consumption.
- Deployment Architecture: Such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the roles of its parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in "Concepts."
