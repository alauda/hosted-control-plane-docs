When writing function documentation, the responsible parties for each function should reasonably split the document pages and directory structure based on the specific characteristics of the function. Prioritize providing CLI operation instructions to help users get started quickly.

1. **Overview**

Function guide documents are typically positioned between function overviews and HowTo documents, focusing on a detailed introduction to a single function. They can cover a detailed description of the function itself.

2. **Core Features**

Function guide documents should have the following core features:

- Concept-Oriented: Systematically explain the core concepts and usage of the function.
- Flexibility: Describe the function without relying on specific scenarios.
- Detailed CLI Explanation: Prioritize providing detailed command-line operation instructions to help users quickly implement the function via CLI. Supplement with the corresponding function interface usage instructions.

3. **Difference Between Function Guide Documentation and HowTo Documentation**

Function documentation often includes some usage and operation instructions, but the difference between it and HowTo documentation can be confusing. The differences are:

- **Content Focus**
  - Function Guide: Answers "what" and "why," helping users understand the function itself.
  - HowTo: Answers "how to do," guiding users to complete specific tasks.

- **Structural Characteristics**
  - Function Guide: Systematic, hierarchical knowledge system focusing on concept explanation and principle elaboration.
  - HowTo: Task-oriented linear operation steps focusing on practical guidance.

- **Usage Scenarios**
  - Function Guide: When users first learn about the function or need to understand the function's principles in-depth.
  - HowTo: When users need to solve specific problems or complete specific tasks.

- **Coverage**
  - Function Guide: Comprehensive introduction to all features, configuration items, and usage methods of the function.
  - HowTo: Specific operation guide for a single scenario or task.

4. **Writing Guide**

When writing function documentation, especially involving CLI, it is recommended to follow these steps:

- Identify the Target Audience: Determine the document's target readers and their needs. Understand their familiarity with CLI to adjust the depth and complexity of the content.
- Structure Content: Divide the document into multiple sections, such as function introduction, detailed CLI command parameters, usage examples, and considerations. Ensure each section is logically clear and easy to understand.
- Detailed Command Explanation: For each CLI command, provide detailed parameter explanations and usage examples. Explain the command's function, applicable scenarios, and possible output results.
