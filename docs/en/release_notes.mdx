# Release Notes

## Initial Release

### Overview

This is the initial release of Alauda Hosted Control Plane, introducing a new approach to Kubernetes cluster management where control plane components run as standard workloads on a management cluster, decoupled from the data plane.

### Core Features

#### Hosted Control Plane Architecture

- **Control Plane as Workload**: Control plane components (API server, controller manager, scheduler) run as Kubernetes deployments and stateful sets on a management cluster
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Complete separation between control plane and data plane, enabling independent scaling and management
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Multiple control planes can be hosted on a single management cluster with proper isolation
- **Kamaji Integration**: Built on Kamaji for robust control plane lifecycle management

#### Storage Backend

- **Etcd Integration**: Support for external etcd clusters as the storage backend for control plane data
- **Shared DataStore**: Single etcd cluster can serve multiple hosted control planes for resource efficiency
- **TLS Security**: Full TLS certificate support for secure communication with etcd clusters
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for multiple etcd endpoints with high availability

#### Infrastructure Management

- **SSH Infrastructure Provider**: Automated worker node provisioning via SSH
- **Machine Lifecycle Management**: Declarative machine deployment and management using Cluster API
- **Host Reusability**: Support for host reuse after machine deletion for resource optimization
- **Flexible Worker Configuration**: Customizable machine templates and bootstrap configurations

#### Networking

- **Calico Network Plugin**: Integrated Calico support for pod networking
- **LoadBalancer Support**: Control plane API server exposed via LoadBalancer service (MetalLB or cloud provider)
- **Konnectivity Integration**: Secure connectivity between control plane and worker nodes
- **Configurable Network CIDRs**: Customizable pod and service network ranges per cluster

#### Container Runtime

- **Containerd Support**: Full support for containerd runtime (version 1.7.27-4)
- **Registry Integration**: Support for private container registries with authentication
- **Image Management**: Automated pull and management of required component images

#### Kubernetes Support

- **Version Compatibility**: Support for Kubernetes v1.32.7 and other versions supported by the global cluster
- **Standard Kubernetes APIs**: Full compatibility with standard Kubernetes APIs and tools
- **Cluster API**: Built on Cluster API (CAPI) for standardized cluster management
- **Kubeadm Bootstrap**: Using kubeadm for worker node configuration

#### Management and Operations

- **Centralized Management**: All hosted control planes managed from a single management cluster
- **Declarative Configuration**: All resources defined using Kubernetes custom resources
- **Status Monitoring**: Built-in status reporting for control planes and worker nodes
- **Alauda Container Platform Integration**: Native integration with ACP management console

#### High Availability

- **Control Plane Replicas**: Support for multiple control plane replicas for high availability
- **Etcd Cluster Support**: Integration with highly available etcd clusters (3, 5, or 7 members)
- **Failure Domain Isolation**: Control plane and data plane failures don't directly impact each other
- **LoadBalancer Resilience**: Automatic failover through LoadBalancer service

### Supported Components

- **Alauda Container Platform Provider Kubeadm**: Kubeadm bootstrap provider
- **Alauda Container Platform Hosted Control Plane**: Core hosted control plane controller
- **Alauda Container Platform SSH Infrastructure Provider**: SSH-based infrastructure provisioning
- **Alauda Build Of etcd Operator**: Etcd cluster operator for backend storage

### Technical Specifications

- **Kubernetes Version**: v1.32.6 (compatible with global cluster versions)
- **Container Runtime**: Containerd 1.7.27-4
- **Network Plugin**: Calico
- **Storage Backend**: Etcd v3.5.21
- **Infrastructure Provider**: SSH
- **Control Plane Manager**: Kamaji
- **Load Balancer**: MetalLB or cloud provider LoadBalancer

### Requirements

- Management cluster running Alauda Container Platform
- LoadBalancer service type support in management cluster
- Worker hosts accessible via SSH
- External etcd cluster with TLS certificates
- Cert-manager for certificate management

### Known Limitations

- Only containerd is supported as the container runtime
- Only etcd is supported as the storage backend driver
- Pod and Service network CIDRs must not overlap with management cluster networks
- SSH-based infrastructure provisioning only
