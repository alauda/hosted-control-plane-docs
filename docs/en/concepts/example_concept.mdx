Provide a detailed introduction to the concepts introduced by the functional module, including parameter explanations and examples. 
If the core concepts are relatively simple, they can be combined into a single document to introduce multiple concepts. Otherwise, it's recommended to dedicate a separate document to each concept. 
For complex and obscure concepts, consider writing a "Understanding XXXX" article in the current directory for an in-depth explanation.

You can view a [Concept Document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/concept/core_example.html) for reference.
