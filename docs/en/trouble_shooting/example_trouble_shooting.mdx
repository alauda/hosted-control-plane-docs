Introduce common issues users may encounter and their solutions. If the content is minimal, it can be placed in a single "Troubleshooting" page. If extensive, consider organizing "Troubleshooting" as a directory, with each issue as a separate document.

You can view a [Troubleshooting Document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/trouble_shooting/example.html) for reference.

:::

# [Title: Usually the Problem Name]

## [Problem Description]

Provide a detailed account of the environment, impact scope, and symptoms of the issue, along with the following supplementary information as needed:

- Problem Description: Text descriptions are preferred. If screenshots are necessary, users should register and discuss with the documentation team.
- Related Logs: Include error messages, system logs, and debugging information in code block format.

## Root Cause

List one or more actual causes that have occurred and led to the issue (can be a single confirmed cause or multiple possible causes). Each cause should meet the following criteria:

1. Must be an actual cause that has occurred and been confirmed to lead to the issue, not speculative or imagined.
2. Provide detailed causal analysis, including:
   - How the cause triggered the issue.
   - The specific mechanism and process of the issue occurrence.

## Troubleshooting (Optional)

List detailed steps for troubleshooting the issue, allowing users to identify the most likely or confirmed cause and apply the appropriate solution. Note the following for troubleshooting:

- If there is only one root cause, provide troubleshooting steps, preferably in an ordered list format.

  ```
  1. Troubleshooting Step 1
  ...
  n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

- If there are multiple root causes with different troubleshooting steps, use level-three headings to list each root cause, and provide detailed troubleshooting steps under each.

  ```
  ### Root Cause 1
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ...
  ### Root Cause N
    1. Troubleshooting Step 1
    ...
    n. Troubleshooting Step N
  ```

## Solution for Root Cause 1 (For multiple root causes, use this title format. For a single root cause, the title should be "Solution")

Provide specific considerations, prerequisites, and steps to resolve the issue.

> **Note**: If there is only one root cause, the level-two heading should be "Solution." If there are multiple root causes with different solutions, each solution should have a separate level-two heading, such as "Solution for Root Cause 1," "Solution for Root Cause N," etc.

### Considerations (Optional)

Important considerations before starting the operation. Failure to read this section carefully may result in operation failure or more severe consequences.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

Conditions that must be met before starting the operation steps.

### Steps (If there are no considerations or prerequisites, this level-three heading can be omitted)

- Steps are generally presented in an ordered list format. If the steps are complex and require additional headings for differentiation, use level-four headings for each step, with specific steps listed in an ordered list format under each.
- If the operation is performed on a container platform, list each step in detail. If on a third-party platform or other software, only provide the key steps.

  > Reason: For non-container platform operations, if written in too much detail, we cannot ensure timely updates when the interface changes, which may lead to many issues. To ensure long-term usability of the documentation, descriptions of third-party platform operation steps should follow these principles:
  >
  > - Highlight core steps and key operations.
  > - Avoid over-reliance on specific interface details.
  > - Maintain generality and flexibility in operation step descriptions.
  > - Ensure users understand the purpose and basic process of the operation.

## Solution for Root Cause N (For multiple root causes, use this title format. For a single root cause, this level-two heading should be deleted)

This section follows the same format as the solution for Root Cause 1 and will not be repeated here.

## Preventive Measures (Optional)

Provide specific measures (suggestions, commands, operations, prerequisites, etc.) to prevent the issue from recurring.

## Related Content (Optional)

Store content used in the document that is inconvenient to place in the main text, such as tool usage methods, references, etc.
